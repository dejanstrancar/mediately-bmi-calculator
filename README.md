## BMI Calculator

The problem is simple. Doctors use a score called BMI to get an idea about a patient’s relative body mass. It’s one of the most used medical calculators out there. The calculation is straightforward:
BMI = weight[kg] / height[m]^2
Make a simple calculator that takes two inputs (weight in kg and height in cm) and displays the calculated BMI and the corresponding category.
